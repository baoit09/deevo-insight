# The network connection profile provides client applications the information about the target
# blockchain network that are necessary for the applications to interact with it. These are all
# knowledge that must be acquired from out-of-band sources. This file provides such a source.
#
name: "global-trade-network"

#
# Any properties with an "x-" prefix will be treated as application-specific, exactly like how naming
# in HTTP headers or swagger properties work. The SDK will simply ignore these fields and leave
# them for the applications to process. This is a mechanism for different components of an application
# to exchange information that are not part of the standard schema described below. In particular,
# the "x-type" property with the "hlfv1" value deevo below is used by Hyperledger Composer to
# determine the type of Fabric networks (v0.6 vs. v1.0) it needs to work with.
#
x-type: "hlfv1"

# Describe what the target network is/does.

# Schema version of the content. Used by the SDK to apply the corresponding parsing rules.
#
version: "1.0"

#
# The client section is SDK-specific. The sample below is for the node.js SDK
#
#client:
  # Which organization does this application instance belong to? The value must be the name of an org
  # defined under "organizations"
  #organization: Org1

  # Some SDKs support pluggable KV stores, the properties under "credentialStore"
  # are implementation specific
  #credentialStore:
    # [Optional]. Specific to FileKeyValueStore.js or similar implementations in other SDKs. Can be others
    # if using an alternative impl. For instance, CouchDBKeyValueStore.js would require an object
    # here for properties like url, db name, etc.
    #path: "/tmp/hfc-kvs"

    # [Optional]. Specific to the CryptoSuite implementation. Software-based implementations like
    # CryptoSuite_ECDSA_AES.js in node SDK requires a key store. PKCS#11 based implementations does
    # not.
    #cryptoStore:
      # Specific to the underlying KeyValueStore that backs the crypto key store.
      #path: "/tmp/hfc-cvs"

    # [Optional]. Specific to Composer environment
    #wallet: wallet-name

#
# [Optional]. But most apps would have this section so that channel objects can be constructed
# based on the content below. If an app is creating channels, then it likely will not need this
# section.
#
channels:
  # name of the channel
  mychannel2:
    # Required. list of orderers designated by the application to use for transactions on this
    # channel. This list can be a result of access control ("org1" can only access "ordererA"), or
    # operational decisions to share loads from applications among the orderers.  The values must
    # be "names" of orgs defined under "organizations/peers"

        # [Optional]. will this peer be sent query proposals? The peer must have the chaincode
